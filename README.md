# The classification of iris flowers is a prominent Python Data analysis project. Each of the three flower classes in the iris dataset—Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica—has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The problem is the identification of Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, and verginica) based on the measures of the sepal and petal length and width. The classification of iris flowers aims to predict flowers based on their distinctive characteristics.
